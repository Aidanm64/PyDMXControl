# PyDMXControl

Just messing around with using Python to do DMX.
Decided I'd kinda do it properly so fixture profiles exist, with a default for normal fixtures and those who need virtual dimmers.
Currently only does an actual output via uDMX. (If someone wants to buy me an Enttec USB DMX Pro then I'll make it work with that too).
